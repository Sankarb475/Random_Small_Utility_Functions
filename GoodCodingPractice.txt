//So far the pointers I have learnt while coding in real life project

1) Always give meaningful name to your methods/variables/classes

2) Try to create/use as less number of variables as possible

3) Give commands on what exactly a method or code snippet does 

4) Focus on the readability of your code, dont just write code and follow the logic, make sure it is readble to the laymen

5) Try to reduce the number of lines of your code

6) Create methods whenever a code snippet gets repeated more than twice, even the method is an one liner
