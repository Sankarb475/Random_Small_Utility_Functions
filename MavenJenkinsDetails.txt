Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
Maven comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging as jar.

Maven features:
  Making the build process easy
  Providing a uniform build system
  Providing quality project information
  Providing guidelines for best practices development
  Allowing transparent migration to new features
  
Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository, 
and stores them in a local cache.

Maven has the following three standard lifecycles âˆ’

1) clean 

cleans the previous build informations
(it deletes the "target" folder from the project where the compiled classes and the jar resides)

2) default(or build)

default(or build) lifecycle is a list of named phases that can be used to give order to goal execution. One of Maven's standard lifecycles 
is the default lifecycle, which includes the following phases, in this order:

 validate ==> 
 Validates whether project is correct and all necessary information is available to complete the build process.
 
 compile ==>
 Compile the source code of the project, the code you have written, that gets compiled.

 test ==>
 Run tests using a suitable unit testing framework (Junit is one).

 package ==>
 Take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.
 
 verify ==>
 Run any check-ups to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
 
 install ==>
 Install the package into the local repository, which can be used as a dependency in other projects locally.
 
 deploy ==>
 Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
 
 
3) site

 Maven Site plugin is generally used to create fresh documentation to create reports, deploy site, etc.
